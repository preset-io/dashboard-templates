  This sales dashboard analyzes transactional data where each row is a sale. The first tab
  shows executive KPIs: two big number cards display total revenue and total items sold,
  both using a date column for trending. Below that, bar charts show quarterly revenue
  patterns, with one chart breaking this down by product category, and another showing
  total revenue by product.

  The second tab digs deeper: a pie chart shows revenue proportion across product categories,
  a heatmap crosses product category against deal size (Small/Medium/Large) to show deal
  density, an area chart reveals seasonal revenue patterns by product, and a horizon chart
  compares revenue across deal size tiers over time.

  Three filters control the view: a multi-select for country/region, a numeric range for
  order quantity, and a date picker for the time period. All charts respond to these filters.

  The key relationships: revenue and quantity are the numeric measures, product line and
  deal size are the categorical breakdowns, order date drives all time-based analysis,
  and country enables geographic filtering.
